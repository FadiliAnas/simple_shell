# Simple Shell Project

## Description

The Simple Shell Project is a minimalist implementation of a command-line shell, providing basic functionality for command execution, environment variable handling, and simple job control. It serves as a learning exercise for understanding the fundamentals of operating systems and system programming.

## Features

- Command execution: Execute external commands and display their output.
- Built-in commands: Support for built-in commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and `exit`.
- Environment variables: Handle environment variables and support for basic variable substitution.
- Job control: Basic job control features, allowing users to run processes in the background (`&`) and bring them to the foreground.
